**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

This project was to create a system to build a program that is able to track items for a corner grocery store.
**What did you do particularly well?**

I think I was able to create a good menu that was easily navigated 
**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**

I had a great deal of trouble trying to find a way to accept input while in a loop. 
**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**

I looked at how other people wrote conditions to advance clocks and used them as guidelines, I found many helpful pointers on stackoverflow
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**

This Project helped me better understand creating a menu and and output file . 
**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

I endeavored to express a significant amount of information within my comments, while simultaneously ensuring they remained concise and manageable. I utilized these comments as a means to leave traces of my attempts to solicit input and to also progress time. This strategy enables anyone who identifies any errors in my attempts at eliciting input to draw my attention to them. The ability to detect key hits seemed like a valuable skill, and thus, I have this to revisit should I acquire the necessary proficiency to execute it successfully.
